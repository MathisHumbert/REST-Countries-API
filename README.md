# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher

This is a Frontend Mento Project.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScrit for this project.
All of the code is from my self.

I learned a lot about AJAX and how to manipulate API.
I also learned more about localStorage to store my country and my color for the single page and also for accessing the country.
